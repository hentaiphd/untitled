i just darkened my own freckles that was 
the biggest risk i took today ugh what is money what is life how am i even alive
where's the wine 
can't afford to live in my own apartment so i'm moving in with the internet

(' ')






my life is an emergency and so is yours
	which leads me to believe that i should legally change my name to something threatening like DRAGONSLUT
														ψ(｀w´)ψ
~ ~ ~

thank god for lunch breaks
because i'm totally convinced
that someone sold my coworker his soul at gamestop

left on broadway
there's 
a zoo of squealing teens
where justin bieber is apparently--
i want to throw a paper plane at him

justin bieber 
i don't love you but 
i do wonder what you think of anime

i'm fucking bored of writing about work
and writing at work
just leave me be
stranded on a highway
like mom did in 10th grade
when i slapped her in the car

pocket full of money
and devoid of all common sense
	siri what is sense
	what is my purpose in life if not to masquerade as an artiste

i'm judging you based on how pimped out your polly pocket mansion is
	i thought, age 12--
	and now
i'm judging you based on whether or not you understand dakimakura

dakimakura dakimakura

KAWAII HAS PERISHED press space bar to continue
THE PARTY IS OVER press space bar to continue
SERIOUSLY GET OUT press space bar to continue



>>>
i am in a constant state of pancake 
	i mean panic

whether about the government paycheck i'm waiting to get in time for rent or
why the original us dub of sailor moon is so homophobic
	why would anyone want to hide such a cute couple
	michiru and haruka i'm totally with you
	babes like babes it's only natural
	and everyone likes babes with teal hair
	obviously

yeah this shit is real to me
i love anime and i hate you
stop judging me

i wanna get 'welcome to windows 98' tattooed on my ass
and no one can stop me

down with my soul and the man etc etc
impale me on a black censor bar
hentai is forever
there's no such thing as breaking news 
unless it's the vase i broke
in a 3rd grade flash of 
pre-teen rebellion

**************

repeat after me

i'm sweet like a cinnamon pecan swirl and 
	so snobby 
	it'll make your heart sweat
i'm a galaxy on pause
i'm not a man or a woman 
but an equation that amounts to
	mathematical uncertainty,
i'm a particle effect
	i'm every little winding pixel
i'm the red ring on your xbox and
i don't like being broken
i don't like it
i don't like instagram but i do like yours so i look at it sometimes
i don't like critiquing your grammar so stop making mistakes i'm not a tutor anymore
shut up
it's spring break and i don't care

people around the world are unhappy and waking up with hangovers
meanwhile i just tweet



()
so far today

two people have said

a computer could easily replace you

cool thanks




if a computer writes better poetry than me 
so be it



talent scares me and so do people
poets scare me too, but so does lightning and math and biology
and everyday activities including but not limited to everything

i know you are but what am i


									i see the opus in your eye





////////////////
the truth is that computers are the most honest things in the world

but you don't have to agree with me 
you don't even have to read this poem
///////////////


so like
you know when your life turns into some fanfiction that a 14 year old literally wrote on xanga
it's life, liberty and day drunk in chinatown
wandering in search of sesame pancakes
and sailor moon merch offered up for free
a girl can dream

spicy wings in july at boka with watermelon soju for the first time
and drunk at decibel again
drunk again what else is new
with emmett and diego what else is new
the lesson is that some friends are a vacation wasteland
a cruel reality check that i hadn't even been living or eating the right brand of cereal 

summer is a supernova splash
turn the volume up i love this part
it's the positive universe charged up on trader joe's wine for $3 whenever i want
i refer to myself as a technophile in a moment of overwhelming word vomit and kiss a programmer
people watching is essentially lurking internet forums in real life
i relax in a cab
watching a midtown club defiled by pop culture from the window seat 

never have i ever known how to
be a functional member of society

my mom always told me 'keep to yourself,'
'just nuke a potato' she would say




/////////////
heaven is a place on habbo hotel but not on earth
heaven is definitely not on the bus
it's not in philly and it's not in the matrix
i'd rather go to the matrix than heaven anyways

a person passes through history on a google search for truth

meanwhile i walk around soho 
which is always like super models-- 
cut to me in a sailor moon crop top
eating chips out of the bag

very different from being 12 at contempo with mom in black heels
tall and gorgeous emerging from a jungle of dress racks
with the last pair of size 0 acid wash jeans
click clack heels on the floor
rouge red lips and eyelashes for miles
fight evil and dress chic
moms are forever for better or worse

her annual gift was barbie or many barbies
one time i was playing sex with ken
until by accident i ripped ken's leg off
which kind of killed the mood

foreshadowing of phallic rebellion, perhaps
but i'd never even heard of a penis
and instead of a traditional sex talk 
i made out with my pillow and rubbed
sexless dolls together
instinctual behavior, i guess

i was in aol cybersex chat rooms before i even knew what sex was

now i know even less about it
my bedroom is an anime bachelor pad
and here i am drinking a cocktail called
'the corpse reviver #2'

i hereby apologize to anyone and everyone i have ever kissed

i emerged from the womb during happy hour

i keep my feelings bottled up

i don't want to ever move again so who's
coming over to feed me oreos

seriously if i don't eat some chocolate right now
i'm going to have a panic attack

meanwhile i wonder about the lack of adult-themed saturday morning cartoons

my life is
a love letter to the internet

it's a suburban legend written in
terminal on May 20th
while everyone looks up
in unison
at the eclipse hovering
over new york

my life is 
a quiet road at night:
summer solstice and
amphibians crossing
the street 
ecstatic in
muddy ponds--
they are safe from the 
headlights that
seldom pass, unlike my
bedroom in brooklyn where
the lights are
always passing

my life is an
excuse to tear clouds down
and arrange them into poems
formless enough for words

it's me sitting in the park watching
everyone, wondering
who is a brony
and which couples
are on okcupid dates

my life is a search for people
who want to go swimming and
talk poetry with me
who want to drink iced coffee
with me
and get tattoos with me

a search for anyone to do
literally anything with me


>>>>>>>>>>>>






in what programming language
do i speak to speak with you

i'm scared that i can't understand 

communication hurts my eyes
because i'm always looking down
at my phone

it's easier to do with background music
filling in the conversation
like madlibs

sit across the table from me
and we can just text

you asked
what is html for kissing
and i said
i dunno
just follow your kokoro



...
my heart is in your hard drive
so please be careful




/////
ok this week is going to suck
it's already raining and my
free donut receipt is ruined
/////

the last time i cried
was on a bus to boston
hiding behind my sunglasses
on i-95

the highway is long and empty
and the distance between us is always growing

you will never carry a sega genesis to your friends
in a plastic bag to play all night
and remember years later alone at the bar
where nostalgia waits 
to pour your 3rd glass

you will never get drunk on friday
night, laughing defiantly in the stranglehold
of city streets and teen angst,
stopping to sit on the granite stoop of a church
wondering how you got there

you'll never have to worry about the subway running,
or how the interview went

with every left turn the bus takes 
i sink more into my seat

where will we meet in ten years
to watch each other quietly 
with your favorite goldfish snack
and every sound you make another
small hope  

i wish i could take you to a pulsar and
hold your hand and watch the earth spin
 

***
remember that
there's a part of you that would die without words

pretty girls are online in panties and 
slipping in piles of font effects

they're looking into webcams eating
strawberry frosted pop-tarts

the pretty girls so addicted to the internet
that she forgets to breathe

she asks
how do i convert this The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time cartridge into a bong™
	among other things

i'm not talking about anyone
	pretty girl

	not any one pretty girl

so hug her hard until she pixilates



she walked into an abercrombie&fitch, 
picked up some $80 shorts 
and started experiencing inexplicable thoughts 
of suicide, arson, defenestration etc

there she is now
breathing heavily into a dorito bag
and watching hulk hogan reality television program, 
etc
her anxiety is relieved
the secret is cablevision

wish i was still in high school 
so that whenever anyone called me a nerd i could be like 
'well i'm fuckin popular on twitter 
so go eat coal'

and now that i'm watching the world
from behind a bookshelf
i wonder
what's a gigbyte taste like

a byte of tylonol
a byte of bread and butter
a byte of porn

i wish i was a hyperlink on an angelfire webpage 
circa 1995

it's 11am and i'm eating a reeses mini cup
it's fine i have a salary and benefits
a macbook air and
