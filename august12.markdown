at this point
i'd sell my soul for a sleeve of
thin mints

i'm the scape goat for modernity
i take the blame for paper-based desire
with internet fetishism on top like a cherry

my toddler spiderman shirt that says 'sports'
in cursive font
is a nice complement to my
job security

someone throw me in a ditch
before i buy these
shiny american apparel booty shorts

i'm devoted to the worst of the worst
consumerism

go steady with your wallett
and get that louis vuitton purse
that will go wonderfully stale
on the shelf by volume after volume
of so-called classics
without dust jackets

yeah that's me
wandering the streets with
3 bottles of wine in an urban outfitters shopping bag

meet me in the backs of malls
nationwide
thanking the devil
for my 6th cigarette

coffee is F5 and alcohol is ESC

is it normal to feel this much emotion
over an e-mail

# 2

let me build a database for
everyone's sense of humor
so i can query for the good ones
and delete the rest

# 3

cannot think about sex without also
thinking about inserting
flash drive into
usb port

very erotic

# 4

it's 2012
and rapid realty
has no apartments located
at the bottom of the sea


why?

# 5

i'll follow you to the ends of the
google search for
'the end'

because our metadata
has chemistry

or at least above 80%
colocation

# 6

if it's not a dorito i don't want it

if it's not a health risk
i don't want it

ruin my ears with this mp3 player on
full volume
the devil made me do it

if i could have anything it would be glasses
with ascii art prescription

wanna see everything in unicode

hey babe, your eyes are
8bit

push some code into
your bloodstream so you
compile faster

run faster baby

what's it like
to lose your virginity on
the internet
anyways

# 7

recurring dream where
i'm a bitch on twitter

the things i aspire to though,
seriously

# 8

who needs the fountain of youth
when you have a blogspot
that shit's forever
type and hit submit
the world will always appreciate
your contribution
to the
never ending mass of data which are
your opinions

suburbs are interesting.
there are bees there and a lot of lonely people.
there's a lot of land lines
and porn
and kids called junior,
there's a lot of verified suburban moms
subscribed to housekeeping
and alarm clocks set to snooze.
alarm clock snoozing rebels.

chase me down the street to
a cool pond and
we can swim there.
bring your laptop and we'll
ftp love letters--
give me a gun and i'll
shoot your
laptop to bits after like it's no big deal.

say good night love
to the internet
because it's more important
to you than me.
